### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in key JavaScript technologies like React, Redux, Node, Express, and Koa. 

I'm passionate about creating high-quality websites and applications with a strong emphasis on user-friendliness. With a background in textile and fashion design, I bring a unique and creative perspective to my work. 

When not working, you're likely to find me immersing myself in the aisles of a bookstore, wandering through a foreign city, or taking a peaceful hike in the mountains or by the sea.

Explore my projects and creative endeavors on my GitHub profile, https://github.com/makekema,  or have a look at my design portfolio, https://magdalena-keller.com.
